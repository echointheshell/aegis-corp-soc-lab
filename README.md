# üõ°Ô∏è Aegis Corporation Lab

The Aegis Corporation Lab is a virtualised environment designed to simulate a simple network infrastructure with integrated security monitoring, threat simulation, and analysis capabilities. The aim is to provide an isolated and controlled environment for hands-on exposure to the tools and techniques associated with security operations and adversary tradecraft.
